# Introduction

:::info

The following modules have been renamed in this version:
- KnowledgeBuilder -> SemanticModel
- DataProductBuilder -> DataProduct

:::


Intugle’s GenAI-powered open-source Python library builds an intelligent semantic model over your existing data systems. At its core, it discovers meaningful relationships across data sets. With this intelligence, you can enable semantic search and auto-generate unified data products, making data exploration faster, more accurate, and far less manual.

## Who is this for?

*   **Data Engineers & Architects** often spend weeks manually profiling, classifying, and stitching together fragmented data assets. With Intugle, they can automate this process end-to-end, uncovering meaningful links and relationships to instantly generate a connected semantic layer.
*   **Data Analysts & Scientists** spend endless hours on data readiness and preparation before they can even start the real analysis. Intugle accelerates this by providing contextual intelligence, automatically generating SQL and reusable data products enriched with relationships and business meaning.
*   **Business Analysts & Decision Makers** are slowed down by constant dependence on technical teams for answers. Intugle removes this bottleneck by enabling natural language queries and semantic search, giving them trusted insights on demand.

## Features

*   **Semantic Data Model:** Transform raw, fragmented datasets into an intelligent semantic graph that captures entities, relationships, and context — the foundation for connected intelligence.
*   **Business Glossary & Semantic Search:** Auto-generate a business glossary and enable search that understands meaning, not just keywords — making data more accessible across technical and business users.
*   **Data Products:** Instantly generate SQL and reusable data products enriched with context, eliminating manual pipelines and accelerating data-to-insight.
