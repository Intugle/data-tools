# Introduction

Intugle’s GenAI-powered open-source Python library builds an intelligent semantic layer over your existing data systems. At its core, it discovers meaningful links and relationships across data assets — enriching them with profiles, classifications, and business glossaries. With this connected knowledge layer, you can enable semantic search and auto-generate queries to create unified data products, making data integration and exploration faster, more accurate, and far less manual.
