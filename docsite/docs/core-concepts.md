# Core Concepts

## Knowledge Builder

The `KnowledgeBuilder` is the main entry point for building the semantic layer. It takes a dictionary of datasets as input and orchestrates the entire process of profiling, link prediction, and business glossary generation.

## Data Product Builder

The `DataProductBuilder` is used to generate data products from the semantic layer. It takes an config dictionary as input and generates a unified data product that can be used for analysis and exploration.

## Semantic Search

The semantic search feature allows you to search for columns in your datasets using natural language. It uses a hybrid search approach that combines dense and sparse vectors for more accurate results.
