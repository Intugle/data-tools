# Examples

For a detailed, hands-on introduction to the project, please see our quickstart notebooks. They provide a complete walkthrough of the library's capabilities using real-world datasets.

*   **Healthcare Dataset**: This notebook walks you through the entire process of building a semantic layer using a healthcare dataset.
    *   [`quickstart_healthcare.ipynb`](https://github.com/Intugle/data-tools/blob/main/notebooks/quickstart_healthcare.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Intugle/data-tools/blob/main/notebooks/quickstart_healthcare.ipynb)

*   **Tech Manufacturing Company Dataset**: This notebook demonstrates how to use the library with a technology manufacturing company dataset.

These notebooks will guide you through the following key steps:

*   **Building a Knowledge Base:** Use the `KnowledgeBuilder` to automatically profile your data, generate a business glossary, and predict links between tables.
*   **Accessing Enriched Metadata:** Learn how to access the profiling results and business glossary for each dataset.
*   **Visualizing Relationships:** Visualize the predicted links between your tables.
*   **Generating Data Products:** Use the semantic layer to generate data products and retrieve data.
*   **Searching the Knowledge Base:** Use semantic search to find relevant columns in your datasets using natural language.
