# Core concepts

This section dives deep into the fundamental components and architectural ideas that power the Intugle Data Tools library.

Understanding these concepts is key to using the library effectively and leveraging its full potential for automating data intelligence.

### Key components

*   [**Semantic Model**](./semantic-model.md): The main orchestrator that manages the end-to-end semantic model pipeline.
*   [**DataSet**](./dataset.md): The central in-memory container for a data source and all its rich metadata.
*   [**Link Prediction**](./link-prediction.md): The process of automatically discovering relationships between your datasets.
*   [**Data Product**](./data-product): The tool used to generate unified data products from the enriched semantic layer.
*   [**Semantic Search**](./semantic-search.md): The feature that enables natural language queries on your connected data assets.
