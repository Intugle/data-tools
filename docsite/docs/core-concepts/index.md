# Core concepts

This section dives deep into the fundamental components and architectural ideas that power the Intugle Data Tools library.

Understanding these concepts is key to using the library effectively and leveraging its full potential for automating data intelligence.

### Key Components
*   **Generate Semantic Model** → The unified layer that transforms fragmented datasets, creating the foundation for connected intelligence.
    *   **1.1 Profile and classify data** → Analyze your data sources to understand their structure, data types, and other characteristics.
    *   **1.2 Discover links & relationships among data** → Reveal meaningful connections (PK & FK) across fragmented tables.
    *   **1.3 Generate a business glossary** → Create business-friendly terms and use them to query data with context.
    *   **1.4 Enable semantic search** → Intelligent search that understands meaning, not just keywords—making data more accessible across both technical and business users.
    *   **1.5 Visualize semantic model** → Get access to enriched metadata of the semantic layer in the form of YAML files and visualize in the form of graph
*   **Build Unified Data Products** → Simply pick the attributes across your data tables, and let the toolkit auto-generate queries with all the required joins, transformations, and aggregations using the semantic layer. When executed, these queries produce reusable data products.
