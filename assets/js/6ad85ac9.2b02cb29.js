At its core, it discovers meaningful links and relationships across data assets \u2014 enriching them with profiles, classifications, and business glossaries. With this connected knowledge layer, you can enable semantic search and auto-generate queries to create unified data products, making data integration and exploration faster, more accurate, and far less manual.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
