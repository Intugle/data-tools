    "# Quickstart: Building a Semantic Layer with Intugle\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is a Semantic Layer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A semantic layer is a business-friendly representation of your data. It hides the complexity of the underlying data sources and provides a unified view of your data using familiar business terms. This makes it easier for both business users and data teams to understand and query the data, accelerating data-driven insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who is this for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is designed for both **data teams** and **business teams**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data teams** can use it to automate data profiling, schema discovery, and documentation, significantly accelerating their workflow.\n",
    "* **Business teams** can use it to gain a better understanding of their data and to perform self-service analytics without needing to write complex SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, you will learn how to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Profile your data:** Analyze your data sources to understand their structure, data types, and other characteristics.\n",
    "2. **Business Glossary Generation:** Generate a business glossary for each column, with support for industry-specific domains.\n",
    "2. **Automatically predict links:** Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically discover relationships (foreign keys) between tables.\n",
    "3. **Generate a semantic layer:** Create YAML files file that defines your semantic layer.\n",
    "4. **Generate SQL queries:** Use the semantic layer to generate SQL queries and retrieve data."

    "\n",
    "You can configure the LLM by setting the following environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `LLM_PROVIDER`: The LLM provider and model to use (e.g., `openai:gpt-3.5-turbo`). The format follows langchain's format for initializing chat models. Checkout how to specify your model [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) \n",
    "* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the LLM provider.\n",
