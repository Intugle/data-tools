    "This notebook guides you through the process of running the Intugle semantic model builder, which is a Streamlit application, directly within a Google Colab environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Colab provides a containerized environment, we cannot directly access the web server started by Streamlit. To solve this, we will use `ngrok`, a tool that creates a secure public URL (a \"tunnel\") to the Streamlit application running inside our Colab instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install** the required Python packages.\n",
    "2.  **Configure and run `ngrok`** to expose the Streamlit app.\n",
    "3.  **Shut down** the tunnel when you are finished."
