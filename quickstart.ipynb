    "# Quickstart: Building a Semantic Layer with Intugle\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a quick introduction to this project. You'll learn how to use its key features to automatically build a semantic layer over your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Semantic Layer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A semantic layer is a business-friendly representation of your data. It hides the complexity of the underlying data sources and provides a unified view of your data using familiar business terms. This makes it easier for both business users and data teams to understand and query the data, accelerating data-driven insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who is this for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is designed for both **data teams** and **business teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Data teams** can use it to automate data profiling, schema discovery, and documentation, significantly accelerating their workflow.\n",
    "*   **Business teams** can use it to gain a better understanding of their data and to perform self-service analytics without needing to write complex SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, you will learn how to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Build a Knowledge Base:** Use the `KnowledgeBuilder` to automatically profile your data, generate a business glossary, and predict links between tables.\n",
    "2.  **Access Enriched Metadata:** Learn how to access the profiling results and business glossary for each dataset.\n",
    "3.  **Visualize Relationships:** Visualize the predicted links between your tables.\n",
    "4.  **Generate Data Products:** Use the semantic layer to generate data products and retrieve data."

    "## 1. LLM Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the project, you need to configure a Large Language Model (LLM). This is used for tasks like generating business glossaries and predicting links between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure the LLM by setting the following environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `LLM_PROVIDER`: The LLM provider and model to use (e.g., `openai:gpt-3.5-turbo`). The format follows langchain's format for initializing chat models. Checkout how to specify your model [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)\n",
    "*   `API_KEY`: Your API key for the LLM provider. The exact name of the variable may vary from provider to provider\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to set these variables in your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export LLM_PROVIDER=\"openai:gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n",
    "export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-openai-api-key\"\n",
    "```\n",
